## Overview

Polls a curated list of Bluesky news accounts every 30 seconds, runs multiple detection strategies, and continuously matches the resulting event corpus against open Kalshi prediction markets. A keyword sweep feed surfaces posts from the wider Bluesky public with configurable noise filtering. Clicking any market title opens a live detail page with pricing, orderbook, price history, position sizing, and Polymarket comparison.

**Four pages:** Home (`/`) · Event Dashboard (`/dashboard`) · Market Dashboard (`/markets`) · Market Detail (`/market_detail?ticker=TICKER`)

---

## Pages & Navigation

Title bar on all pages: **Event Trading Terminal** brand (16px bold) → nav links → right side. All pages show the KLTT Holdings logo (`/static/kltt-logo.png`, 22px height) in the title bar right side. Market Dashboard right side additionally has Syncing pill, Pause, and Refresh.

### Event Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

| Panel | Contents |
|-------|---------|
| **News Accounts** | Live feed from tracked priority accounts. Collapsible **Tracked Accounts** bar (add/remove, persists to `accounts.txt`). |
| **Detected Events** | Events CRITICAL→HIGH→MEDIUM. Each card shows a two-line header: `[what]` on line 1, `[who]` · `[where]` · `[when]` on line 2 (labels always shown; "unknown" when not extractable). Collapsible **Spikes** bar. |
| **Keyword Sweep** | Broad keyword search feed. Collapsible **Keywords** bar (add/pause/remove, persists to `custom_feeds.json`). Noise Filter slider. |

All collapsible bars use the shared `.cbar` CSS system: `.cbar` → `.cbar-header` → `.cbar-arrow` + `.cbar-label` + `.cbar-count`, and `.cbar-body`. Collapse rotates arrow; count always visible.

The loading overlay on both Event Dashboard and Market Dashboard shows live Kalshi fetch progress: page count, running market count, elapsed time, and a step-by-step status indicator (Flask server → Bluesky feed → Kalshi API fetch → Market indexing → Ready).

### Market Dashboard (`/markets`)

Three columns, aligned via spacers: header → [spacers or strat-tabs] → **Category pills (all 13, always shown)** → column controls → paginated body → footer.

| Column | Controls |
|--------|---------|
| **All Markets** | Spacers + Category pills + Search + Price/Days sliders + Sort strip + Series list + Market cards |
| **Event Matches** | Spacer + Confidence slider (default ≥0.60) + Sort + Category pills + Results |
| **Expiry & Price Strategies** | Sub-tabs (default: **Extreme**) + Filter strip + Category pills + Results |

Market title text in all three columns is a hyperlink that opens the Market Detail page in a new tab.

Title bar right side includes a **Syncing pill** (blue `↻ Syncing` indicator) that appears non-blocking during hourly background Kalshi refreshes and manual Refresh clicks, disappearing when the pull completes.

Key layout: `overflow-y: hidden` on all paginated bodies (no internal scroll). `calibratePerPage()` measures actual card heights after first render and sets items-per-page dynamically. Sub-header removed; Pause/Refresh in title bar.

### Market Detail (`/market_detail?ticker=TICKER`)

Standalone page opened in a new tab from any market card. Makes three parallel live API calls on load (refreshable via header button):

1. `GET /api/kalshi/market/<ticker>` — live market data, orderbook, 30-day candlesticks
2. `GET /api/kalshi/match_detail` — semantic match breakdown (events + Bluesky posts)
3. `GET /api/polymarket/match` — fuzzy-matched Polymarket markets for comparison

**Sections (top to bottom):**
- **Hero card** — market title, ticker, category, time remaining, live dot, Kalshi deep link
- **All Outcomes** — for multi-outcome events (e.g. "Who will be X?"), shows all sibling markets sorted by YES ask with probability bars and links to their own detail pages
- **Polymarket Comparison** — top 5 fuzzy-matched Polymarket markets by similarity score, with odds, volume, end date, and similarity explanation
- **Context callouts** — break-even probability, price drift vs last trade, time value note
- **Position Sizer** — dollar input ($1–$100k) + log-scale slider; shows contracts, total cost, gross profit, total fees (correct per-contract formula), net profit, return %, and fill feasibility (depth check with price impact warning). Synced to YES/NO toggle.
- **YES / NO toggle** — switches pricing panels and sizer calculations between sides. Each panel shows: ask, bid, gross profit per contract, fee (~3% of profit, min $0.01/contract), net profit, return %.
- **Shared spread + volume row** — spread in `$0.XX` format with color coding (green ≤$0.01, amber $0.02–$0.03, red ≥$0.04), volume, liquidity, last trade
- **Order Book** — live bid depth for YES and NO sides, quantity bars clipped to row bounds
- **Price Chart** — 30-day YES ask history as SVG line chart with fill gradient, y-axis in `$0.XX` format
- **Matched Events** — events that drove the semantic match score
- **Matched Bluesky Posts** — individual posts that matched this market

All price values displayed as `$0.XX` (dollar format), not raw cents.

Collapsible `ⓘ` glossaries on Pricing, Order Book, Price Chart, Position Sizer, and Polymarket sections explain each data point in plain language.

## Noise Scoring System

**File:** `post_scorer.py` | Priority account posts bypass scoring entirely.

| ID | Filter | Signal | Points |
|----|--------|---------|--------|
| F1 | Content length | < 20 chars | +5 |
| F2 | Account age | < 3d / 3–7d | +5 / +2 |
| F3 | Hashtag count | > 3 / == 3 | +4 / +2 |
| F4 | Engagement | zero / ≥3 (bonus) | +1 / −1 |
| F5 | Solicitation | follow-farming phrases | +5 |
| F6 | Reply | is_reply | +3 |
| F7 | Language | non-English | +3 |
| F11 | URL-only | < 3 real words | +4 |
| F12 | Mentions | > 3 / > 5 @mentions | +2 / +4 |
| F13 | Repeated handle | 3×+ in batch | +2–3 |
| F14 | Topical relevance | zero signal words in post | +3 (hide) |

Score buckets (default threshold **3**): **clean** 0–2, **dim** never reached at threshold 3 (hide fires first), **hide** ≥3. Threshold adjustable live via slider in Keyword Sweep panel (default lowered from 5 → 3 in v1.6).

Pending (disabled): F8 follower count, F9 post count, F10 bio — require `getProfile` API calls.

---

## Event Detection Engine

**File:** `event_detector.py` | Pluggable strategy pattern.

**KeywordClusterStrategy** — Groups posts by keywords in a 10-minute window. Source tier weights (Reuters/AP=5 … `fintwitter`=3 … generic=1; 16 accounts from `accounts.txt` now explicitly weighted). Fires at CLUSTER_THRESHOLD=3 (higher for ambiguous words and format-label phrases — see quality gates below). Includes dim/hide skip, negation check, historical reference filter, entity requirement, coherence check, and semantic dedup. Format-label phrases (`breaking:`, `breaking --`) removed from CRITICAL triggers — were matching any post starting with BREAKING: regardless of content.

**VelocitySpikeStrategy** — Detects volume surges. Drives the Spikes bar. Now applies the same quality gates as `KeywordClusterStrategy`: dim/hide post skip at ingest; historical reference filter per-word at ingest; `_spike_entity_coherent` gate (requires ≥2 posts sharing a named entity near the spiking word, or 1 news account post with a nearby entity); semantic titles via `_generate_spike_title` (reuses `_extract_semantic_title`).

**ZeroShotStrategy** — Cosine similarity against 7 category descriptions. Fires MEDIUM events at confidence ≥0.32 (requires sentence-transformers).

**Lifecycle:** breaking (<30min), developing (30min–4h), stale (>4h, dropped). Max 50 events.

### Event Quality Gates (v2.1)

Four filters applied before a cluster fires as an event, all fail-open (never suppress when evidence is absent):

**#1 — Cluster coherence** (`_check_cluster_coherence`): For clusters of 3+ posts, at least 50% of posts must share at least one named entity with another post in the cluster. Prevents unrelated posts that happen to share a trigger word (e.g. "attack" in a Tehran news story + "attack" in a 2023 street art post) from forming a false event. Wire alerts and geo/entity-keyed clusters are exempt.

**#2 — Entity requirement for ambiguous words and format-label phrases** (`ENTITY_REQUIRED_WORDS` + `ENTITY_REQUIRED_PHRASES`): High-ambiguity single-word triggers (including `breaking`) and format-label phrases (`breaking news`, `just in`, `developing story`, `flash alert`, `developing situation`) require at least one named entity per post. Falls back to capitalised proper noun regex when spaCy is unavailable.

**#3 — Historical reference filter** (`is_historical_reference` in `nlp_enhancer.py`): Posts referencing a past year (2000–2023) within 80 characters of the trigger keyword, or using retrospective framing phrases ("after the attack", "since the shooting", "anniversary of", "looking back"), are excluded from clusters. Priority accounts and news accounts are exempt.

**#4 — Per-word threshold overrides** (`CLUSTER_THRESHOLD_OVERRIDES`): Ambiguous single-word triggers require higher cluster weight before firing. `attack`, `crisis`, `shooting`, `crash`, `explosion`, `protest`, `arrested`, `missing`, `election` → weight 5 (vs. global default of 3). `sanctions`, `collision`, `outbreak`, `wildfire`, `floods`, `coup` → weight 4.

### Semantic Event Titles

`_generate_title` now calls `_extract_semantic_title` for standard keyword matches, building a descriptive **WHO — WHAT [— WHERE]** title from the highest-weight post's content.

Logic (in priority order):
1. **geo:/person:/ent: prefixed keywords** — structured key used directly
2. **wire_alert** — wire header parsed and truncated at colon/em-dash
3. **All other keywords** — entities extracted, demonyms normalised, action modifiers detected, object prepositional phrases extracted, WHO/WHERE deduplicated by root

**`_NORP_TO_COUNTRY`** (module-level dict, 30 entries) — maps demonym/nationality forms to canonical country names: "Iranian" → "Iran", "Qatari" → "Qatar", "Ukrainian" → "Ukraine", etc.

**`COUNTRY_NAMES`** expanded with 30+ key cities, territories, and regions: Gaza, Kyiv, Tehran, Baghdad, Red Sea, Taiwan Strait, Donbas, Strait of Hormuz, etc.

Example: `"BREAKING An Iranian missile attack has damaged Qatar's main gas facility"` → **"Iran — Missile Attack — Qatar"**

**Structured event components:** `_extract_semantic_title` now returns a `{who, what, where}` dict instead of a concatenated string. These components are stored directly on the event object and used by the event card UI to render a two-line header: line 1 is `[what]`, line 2 shows `[who]`, `[where]`, and `[when]` with their labels. Missing components display as "unknown" in muted italic.

**Impact on Event Matches column:** Richer event titles feed better tokens into the Kalshi semantic match corpus. The quality gates also reduce false-positive events, cleaning up the corpus overall.

---

## NLP Enhancement Layer

**File:** `nlp_enhancer.py` | All features degrade gracefully.

- **Phase 1** — NER (spaCy or 5-pass regex) + negation detection
- **Phase 1 (v1.5)** — `is_historical_reference(text, keyword)`: detects past-year proximity and retrospective framing phrases to filter historical references from event clusters
- **Phase 1 (v1.6)** — `extract_entities` used by `_spike_entity_coherent` in VelocitySpikeStrategy for entity coherence gating
- **Phase 3** — Semantic dedup (cosine ≥0.75, or TF-IDF ≥0.40 fallback)
- **Phase 4** — Zero-shot classification (7 categories)

```bash
pip install spacy && python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm  # Phase 1
pip install sentence-transformers                              # Phase 3+4
```

### `is_historical_reference(text, keyword)`

Two conservative checks (fail-open):

1. **Past year proximity** — text contains a year in 2000–2023 within 80 chars of the keyword. Catches "the October **2023** Hamas **attack** on Israel".
2. **Retrospective framing** — keyword appears inside/after phrases like "after the", "since the", "anniversary of", "looking back", "on this day". Catches "street art painted **after the attack**".

Priority/news account posts are exempt.

---

## Semantic Market Matcher

**File:** `kalshi_feed.py` + `app.py`

Markets pre-indexed as word bigram frozensets (`_tok` key, stripped before cache write). Background thread scores all markets against corpus. Results cached; `get_match_results()` returns instantly.

Sort modes: **Confidence** (score desc), **Prob ↑↓** (yes_ask), **Value** (score × price uncertainty).

Event dedup: same `event_ticker` grouped under one card with expandable siblings.

**Pre-open market filter:** Markets with `open_time` in the future are excluded at ingest time. The number of dropped markets is logged per pull.

**Fetch progress:** `_fetch_pages` and `_fetch_running` updated after each API page via a progress callback. Both exposed on `/api/kalshi/status` and displayed in the loading overlay.

---

## Market Dashboard — All Markets

- Category pills from `CANONICAL_CATS` constant (13 categories, always all shown). Empty = dimmed, `cursor:default`. Click delegates to `mpSelectCat(cat, null)`.
- Series list: `overflow-y: auto` (only scroll element in column 1)
- Market body: `overflow-y: hidden` — paginated via `mpChangePage()`
- `MP_PER_PAGE` starts at 14, calibrated dynamically after first render
- Price/days sliders: dual-handle, fill bar updates live
- Sort: Default / Price ↑ / Price ↓ / Closing ↑ / Closing ↓
- **Market titles are hyperlinks** opening `/market_detail?ticker=TICKER` in a new tab

---

## Market Dashboard — Event Matches

- Confidence default: **≥0.60** (slider value 60, `mpConfThreshold = 0.60`)
- Sort: Conf / Prob ↓ / Prob ↑ / Value
- `mpExcludedCats` preserved across background refreshes — `mpBuildMatchCatRow()` never clears it
- `mpFetchMatch(resetPage=false)` called by interval (preserves page); `resetPage=true` on confidence change or init
- `MP_PER_PAGE` calibrated dynamically
- **Market titles are hyperlinks** opening `/market_detail?ticker=TICKER` in a new tab
- Match quality benefits indirectly from v2.1 event quality improvements: fewer false-positive events and richer semantic titles ("Iran — Missile Attack — Qatar" vs "Attack") produce better token overlap with relevant Kalshi markets

---

## Market Dashboard — Expiry & Price Strategies

Default tab: **Extreme** (HTML `active` class on `strat-tab-extreme`; JS `stratActiveTab = 'extreme'`). All tabs auto-refresh every 60s. `STRAT_DISPLAY_PER` calibrated dynamically (starts 11). Category exclusions preserved across refreshes; only cleared on explicit tab switch.

### Extreme Tab — Full State Defaults

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `stratActiveTab` | `'extreme'` | Opens on Extreme |
| `stratExtremeThresh` | `10` | Edge ≤10¢/≥90¢ |
| `stratExtremeDays` | `1` | Within 1 day |
| `stratExtremeSort` | `'close'` | Closing ↑ (soonest first) |
| `stratHideClosed` | `true` | Hide closed markets |
| `stratExtremeMinVol` | `0` | Any volume |

### Extreme Tab — Controls

Within (1d/**3d**/7d/All) · Edge (≤5¢/≥95¢, **≤10¢/≥90¢**, ≤15¢/≥85¢, ≤20¢/≥80¢) · Sort (Extremity, Spread ↑, **Closing ↑**) · Min Vol (Any/100+/500+) · **Hide closed** (default active)

### Extreme Tab — Card Display

Each card shows (beyond title + YES/NO prices):
- **Time** — `Xh Ym` for sub-day (e.g. `4h 22m`, `45m`); full days for longer. Label: `mins` / `hrs` / `days` / `closed`
- **Urgency bar** — red (<6h/0.25d), amber (<1d), green (>1d); uses price extremity when Within=All
- **FAVOURITE/UNDERDOG badge** with price
- **Spread N¢ (X%)** — spread as % of underdog position cost; green ≤1¢, amber 2–3¢, red 4¢+
- **Fee ~N¢ · net N¢** — Kalshi ~3% fee and net profit per contract
- **↗ kalshi** — deep link
- **Market title** — hyperlink to Market Detail page

### Filter Preservation (both Match and Strat)

`stratBuildCatPills()` rebuilds visuals without touching `stratExcludedCats`. Only `stratSwitchTab()` clears exclusions (intentional). Same pattern for `mpBuildMatchCatRow()` / `mpExcludedCats`.

---

## Market Detail Page

**Route:** `GET /market_detail?ticker=TICKER` | **File:** `market_detail.html`

Opens in a new tab from any market card title in the dashboard. All data is fetched live on open — not from cache — and can be refreshed via the header button.

### Live API Calls (parallel on load)

| Endpoint | Data |
|----------|------|
| `GET /api/kalshi/market/<ticker>` | Market object, orderbook, 30-day candlesticks, sibling markets in same event |
| `GET /api/kalshi/match_detail?ticker=TICKER&threshold=0.05` | Per-source semantic match breakdown |
| `GET /api/polymarket/match?ticker=TICKER` | Top 5 fuzzy-matched Polymarket markets |
| `GET /api/manifold/match?ticker=TICKER` | Top 5 fuzzy-matched Manifold Markets questions (new in v1.7) |
| `GET /api/metaculus/match?ticker=TICKER` | Top 5 fuzzy-matched Metaculus questions (new in v1.7) |

### `/api/kalshi/market/<ticker>` — Response Shape

```json
{
  "market":      { ...full Kalshi market object... },
  "orderbook":   { "yes": [[price, qty], ...], "no": [[price, qty], ...] },
  "candlesticks": [ { "end_period_ts": 0, "yes_ask": { "close": "0.60" }, ... } ],
  "siblings":    [ { "ticker", "subtitle", "yes_ask_dollars", "no_ask_dollars", "volume" } ]
}
```

Candlesticks use `period_interval=1440` (1-day candles), last 30 days. Siblings are all markets sharing the same `event_ticker`, sorted by YES ask descending (most likely first), excluding the current market.

### Position Sizer — Fee Formula

Kalshi charges ~3% of profit per contract, minimum $0.01 per contract:

```
feePerContract = max($0.01, (1 - askDollars) * 0.03)
totalFee       = contracts × feePerContract
netProfit      = grossProfit − totalFee
returnPct      = netProfit / totalCost × 100
```

### Polymarket Matching — `/api/polymarket/match`

1. Extracts meaningful keywords from Kalshi market title + subtitle (stops removed)
2. Fires up to 2 searches against `gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets?q=...&active=true`
3. Scores each result with bidirectional token-overlap: `(forward + reverse) / 2`
4. Returns top 5 above 5% similarity threshold with: score, question, YES%, NO%, volume, end date, direct URL

`outcomePrices` from Polymarket is a JSON-encoded string — parsed before scoring. Multi-outcome markets (>2 outcomes) display all outcomes with individual probability bars.

Score color coding: blue ≥35% (strong match), amber 18–34% (plausible), grey <18% (weak).

Kalshi data loads in background from SQLite (`data/kalshi.db`), created automatically on first run. Loading overlays show live fetch progress. Kalshi cache refreshes automatically at the top of each UTC hour. `sqlite3` is Python stdlib — no extra install needed.

**File changes require:**
- `.py` files → Flask restart (`Ctrl+C`, `python app.py`)
- `.html` files → browser hard-refresh (`Cmd+Shift+R`) only

## Configuration & Tuning

### `bluesky_feed.py`

| Constant | Default | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `ACCOUNTS_FILE` | `accounts.txt` | Tracked handles |
| `CUSTOM_FEEDS_FILE` | `custom_feeds.json` | Persisted keyword feeds |
| `MAX_CACHED_POSTS` | 150 | Posts in memory |

**Default FEED_CONFIG (11 feeds):**
Format labels (`just in`, `developing story`, `flash alert`) removed — spam-dominated; covered defensively by `ENTITY_REQUIRED_PHRASES`. Multi-word queries split into atomic feeds; ambiguous terms quoted.

| ID | Query | Limit |

### `event_detector.py`

`CLUSTER_THRESHOLD=3` · `CLUSTER_WINDOW_MINUTES=10` · `MAX_EVENTS=50` · `AGE_BREAKING_MAX=30min` · `AGE_DEVELOPING_MAX=240min`

**Quality gate tuning:**

`ENTITY_REQUIRED_WORDS` — set of single-word triggers requiring a named entity per post. Add words to tighten; remove to loosen.

`CLUSTER_THRESHOLD_OVERRIDES` — dict mapping ambiguous keywords to higher weight thresholds. Defaults: `attack/crisis/shooting/crash/explosion/protest/arrested/missing/election → 5`, `sanctions/collision/outbreak/wildfire/floods/coup → 4`. Tune per-word if legitimate events are suppressed.

`_NORP_TO_COUNTRY` (module-level dict) — demonym → canonical country name map for title generation. Add entries for any demonym not resolving correctly.

`COUNTRY_NAMES` — set of country names, demonyms, cities, territories, and regions for entity extraction fallback. Includes Gaza, Kyiv, Tehran, Red Sea, Taiwan Strait, and others.

### `kalshi_feed.py`

`THRESHOLD_LOW=0.15` · `_BLOCKED_SERIES_PREFIXES=('KXMVE',)` · `PAGE_LIMIT=1000`

**Storage:** Markets and series are persisted to `data/kalshi.db` (SQLite, WAL mode). `filter_markets` queries indexed SQL columns directly — no full RAM scan. `self._markets` is kept in RAM solely for the token scoring engine. On first run, legacy `kalshi_markets.json` / `kalshi_series.json` are automatically migrated to SQLite and can be deleted afterward.

**Refresh cadence:** Hourly at the top of each UTC hour (`_hourly_loop`). Cache freshness checked via `meta.last_updated` row in SQLite (replaces file mtime check). Pre-open markets (future `open_time`) filtered at ingest.

**Fetch progress:** `_fetch_pages` and `_fetch_running` updated after each API page via `progress_cb`. Both exposed on `/api/kalshi/status`. Loading overlays poll every 2 seconds to display live pull progress.

**Dual API domains:** Fetches from both `api.elections.kalshi.com` and `trading-api.kalshi.com`, merges by ticker. Election/political markets live on the elections domain; weather/temperature/sports markets live on the trading domain. Results deduplicated by `ticker` field.

### `post_scorer.py`

`SCORE_HIDE=5` · `SCORE_DIM=3` (thresholds; UI default now 3)

`_SIGNAL_VOCAB` — frozenset of ~120 news/event signal words used by F14. Add words to expand topical coverage (e.g. adding a new topic area to your feeds). A post with zero matching tokens receives +3 (hide). Priority/news account posts are exempt.

### `nlp_enhancer.py`

`DEDUP_THRESHOLD_SEMANTIC=0.75` · `DEDUP_THRESHOLD_TFIDF=0.40` · `DEDUP_WINDOW=50`

`_HISTORICAL_YEAR_RE` — regex matching years 2000–2023. Update the upper bound each year to keep the current year from being treated as historical.

`_HISTORICAL_PHRASES` — frozenset of retrospective framing phrases. Add phrases to catch more historical references; be conservative to avoid false suppressions.

### `app.py`

`_LOCATION_ALIASES` — dict mapping city names to Kalshi location codes (e.g. `'san antonio' → ['satx']`). Extend when new weather/temperature markets for unlisted cities are added. Search automatically expands city name queries to their corresponding codes and vice versa.

### `gas_prices.py`

`REFRESH_HOURS_UTC={0,8,16}`

## Known Limitations / Future Work

- **Kalshi volume data:** `volume` and `volume_fp` fields are often `null` in the API response. The Min Vol filter in the Extreme tab and the Position Sizer depth check have limited effectiveness until this is reliably populated.
- **Bluesky profile filters (F8/F9/F10):** Follower count, post count, and bio filters are implemented but disabled — they require `getProfile` API calls. A profile cache would enable them without rate limit issues.
- **Kalshi semantic matching:** Uses token overlap (unigrams + word bigrams), not embedding-based similarity. Embedding-based matching would improve quality but requires indexing ~35k markets as vectors.
- **Polymarket search:** The Gamma API `?q=` search is keyword-based. Fuzzy matching relies on token overlap against keyword search results. Low-similarity results (<18%) should be treated as coincidental.
- **Event title actor/target ordering:** `_extract_semantic_title` picks the first matching entity as WHO, which can invert actor and target in some posts (e.g. "Russia launches drone attack on Ukrainian..." → WHO=Ukraine because "Ukrainian" appears first in the text). spaCy dependency parsing would fix this correctly.
- **Event quality gate #5 (planned):** Source diversity requirement — a cluster should come from at least 2 distinct source domains. Would go in the cluster acceptance gate alongside #1–#4.
- **`_HISTORICAL_YEAR_RE` upper bound:** Currently matches 2000–2023. Update the upper bound annually.
- **markets.html size:** At ~3200 lines, consider splitting JS into a separate file if it grows further.
- **market_detail.html candlestick granularity:** Uses `period_interval=1440` (daily). Sub-day charts are available via the Kalshi API but not currently exposed.
- **Manifold/Metaculus matching:** Same token-overlap approach as Polymarket — semantic similarity not used. Manifold volume is in Mana (M), not dollars. Metaculus shows forecaster count rather than volume.
- **Kalshi dual-domain coverage:** Markets are fetched from both `api.elections.kalshi.com` and `trading-api.kalshi.com` and merged by ticker. If Kalshi adds a third domain or restructures their APIs, `KALSHI_TRADING_BASE` in `kalshi_feed.py` would need updating.
- **SQLite token columns:** The `_tok` frozenset is not stored in SQLite (not serialisable). It is rebuilt in RAM at load time via `_index_market_tokens`. If the scoring formula changes, the RAM index rebuilds automatically on next startup.
- **Event card [who]/[where] accuracy:** `_extract_semantic_title` uses word-list entity extraction when spaCy is unavailable. Actor/target order can be inverted in posts where a demonym appears before the country name. spaCy dependency parsing would improve this.
- **F14 `_SIGNAL_VOCAB` coverage:** The vocabulary is manually curated. New feed topics outside the current set (entertainment, sports, etc.) would need vocab additions to avoid false hides.

Fee formula corrected to per-contract basis. |
| v1.5 | **Event quality gates (v2.1)**: #1 cluster coherence (entity overlap); #2 entity requirement for 20 ambiguous words (`ENTITY_REQUIRED_WORDS`); #3 historical reference filter (`is_historical_reference` in nlp_enhancer — past-year proximity + retrospective framing); #4 per-word threshold overrides (`CLUSTER_THRESHOLD_OVERRIDES`). **Semantic event titles**: `_extract_semantic_title` builds WHO — WHAT — WHERE from post content using NER, `_NORP_TO_COUNTRY` demonym normalisation (30 entries), action modifier detection, and object phrase extraction. `COUNTRY_NAMES` expanded with 30+ cities/territories/regions. **Loading overlays**: both dashboards show live Kalshi fetch progress (page count, running market count, elapsed time, step indicators). |
| v1.8 | **SQLite migration**: `kalshi_feed.py` persistence layer replaced — markets and series stored in `data/kalshi.db` (SQLite, WAL mode) instead of `kalshi_markets.json`. `filter_markets` now runs indexed SQL queries (`category`, `series_ticker`, `yes_price_cents`, `close_ts` all indexed) instead of full RAM scans. `self._markets` retained in RAM for token scoring only. One-time automatic migration from legacy JSON on first run. `_db_connect`, `_db_is_fresh`, `_db_load_markets/series`, `_db_save_markets/series`, `_db_filter_markets` added; `_cache_is_fresh`/`_load_cache`/`_save_cache` retained as legacy-only helpers. |
| v1.7 | **Market Detail page redesign**: two-column layout (`ctx-sizer-cols` for context+sizer side-by-side, `inner-cols` for chart+orderbook side-by-side); three prediction market comparison panels side-by-side (`comparisons-cols` — Polymarket, Manifold, Metaculus); Matched Events + Posts in `matches-cols` full-width grid; siblings table paginated (10 per page, Prev/Next nav); price chart fixed (`close_dollars` field, was silently returning null); Order Book header moved inside bordered box. **Manifold + Metaculus**: new `/api/manifold/match` and `/api/metaculus/match` routes; `buildManifold` + `buildMetaculus` JS functions; all three comparisons fetched in parallel on page load. **Polymarket**: closed markets filtered from comparison results. **Dual Kalshi API**: `kalshi_feed.py` now fetches from both `api.elections.kalshi.com` and `trading-api.kalshi.com` and merges by ticker — covers weather/temperature and other non-election markets previously missing. `/api/kalshi/market/<ticker>` also tries both domains. **Category name fix**: `_infer_category` corrected `'Climate'` → `'Climate and Weather'` and `'Tech & Science'` → `'Science and Technology'` to match `CANONICAL_CATS`. **All Markets search redesign**: search bar moved to top of column (aligns with Confidence slider in col 2); filter priority enforced — category primary, series secondary, search tertiary; `mpBuildSearchSeriesList` fetches all matching series in one background call (stable across pagination); `mpSelectCat` preserves search query and re-scopes it; `mpSelectSeries` clears search on drill-down. **Search expanded**: matches `series_ticker` + `event_ticker` in addition to title/subtitle/ticker. **`_LOCATION_ALIASES`**: 40+ city-name → Kalshi location-code mappings so searching "san antonio" finds `KXHIGHTSATX` markets. |
| v1.6 | **Feed enabled fix**: `bluesky_feed.py` fetch loop now respects the `enabled` flag — disabled feeds are skipped at fetch time (was only persisted, not enforced). **FEED_CONFIG restructured**: 8 → 11 atomic feeds; format-label feeds removed (`just in`, `developing story`, `flash alert`); ambiguous queries split and quoted (`"rate hike"`, `"market crash"`, `"breaking news"`, `"declared emergency"`, `"interest rate"`, `"fed reserve"`). **Source weights**: 16 accounts from `accounts.txt` now explicitly weighted in `SOURCE_TIER_WEIGHTS`; `fintwitter` promoted to 3; `ms.now` (MSNBC) added at 2. **Breaking: phrases removed**: `breaking:`, `breaking --`, `breaking —` removed from CRITICAL triggers — were matching any post opening with "BREAKING:" regardless of content. `breaking` bare word added to `ENTITY_REQUIRED_WORDS` + threshold 5. `ENTITY_REQUIRED_PHRASES` added for format-label phrases. **VelocitySpikeStrategy improvements**: dim/hide skip at ingest; per-word historical reference filter at ingest; `_spike_entity_coherent` gate (entity coherence across posts); semantic titles via `_generate_spike_title` reusing `_extract_semantic_title`. **F14 TopicalRelevanceFilter**: new `post_scorer.py` filter; posts with zero words from `_SIGNAL_VOCAB` (~120 news/event terms) receive +3 (hide). **Structured event components**: `_extract_semantic_title` returns `{who, what, where}` dict; all three strategies store components on event objects. **Event card redesign**: two-line header — `[what]` on line 1; `[who]` · `[where]` · `[when]` on line 2 with bracket labels; "unknown" shown in muted italic when unavailable. **Noise filter default**: keyword sweep hide threshold lowered 5 → 3. **Logo**: KLTT Holdings text replaced with `kltt-logo.png` on all three pages (drop in `EventDashboard/static/`). **Updated panel**: market bar "Updated" text now vertical, inward-facing, single line showing "Updated · Xm ago". **Collapsible bars**: Tracked Accounts, Spikes, Keywords bars now default to collapsed on startup. **Dashboard overlay**: Event Dashboard loading overlay replaced with full step-indicator + page-counter version matching Market Dashboard. **Bug fixes**: overlay `pollTimer` race fixed on both dashboards (both `resolvedImmediately` + `shown` guards); `_generate_spike_title` dict handling; `ZeroShotStrategy` stale variable references (`pseudo_cluster`, `sorted_c`); `self._extract_semantic_title` called on wrong class in spike/zero-shot strategies. |
